The assignment objective was to clean up and consolidate the HTML and CSS of this marketing company's webpage in order to:

- Replaced all one-off classes with IDs
- Added Alt tags to all images and icons
- Removed unnecessary '/' from Img tags
- Added Role and Aria-label tags to Hero section (see [Contributions](#contributions))


## CSS Refactor
- Selectors and properties consolidated
- Code re-ordered to match semantic structure of HTML
- Commented section headers added
- Type styles defined in a discreet section


## Contributions

I followed guidance and formatting from [David MacDonald](http://www.davidmacd.com/blog/alternate-text-for-css-background-images.html) on the topic of applying Alt text for background images.
